### Built-in array methods
    - push(): Appends new elements to an array, and returns the new length of the array.
    - unshift(): Inserts new elements at the start of the array
    - pop(): Removes the last inserted element in the array
    - splice(): Removes elements from an array and, if necessary, inserts new elements in their place, returning the deleted elements.
    - indexOf(): Returns the position of a specified element
